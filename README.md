# Airbnb Price Predictions

## Overview of the Project

In this project, we work with Airbnb listing data for the city of New York. We will take into considerations informations like property type, room type, location, ratings and seasonality to predict the price. Data is obtained from insideairbnb.com. 

The reason we took on this task, is to utilize machine learning modeling (i.e. statistical model) to predict the optimal Airbnb list prices of New York metropolitan areas using some form of predictive analytics, while comparing dependent variables such as neighborhood, ratings (numeric), property types, beds and bathrooms against independent variable, price. 

In this first part, we clean, organize and perfom exploratory data analysisnon our datasets so that they are ready for analysis. 

## Machine Learning Model Mockup
Since price is a continuous variable, we will use linear regression for our machine learning model. We will use Scikit-learn library, a python machine learning library.The target variable is Price, meaning that the goal of the linear regression model is to predict a price based on some of available features. Database we will use is AWS.
