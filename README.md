# Team_5-Airbnb

### Overview of the Project

In this project, we will predict Airbnb optimal listing price for the city of New York. We will take into considerations informations like property type, room type, location, ratings and seasonality to predict the price.

### Machine Learning Model Mockup
Since we are predicting the price, we will use linear regression for our machine learning model
