# Team_5-Airbnb

### Overview of the Project

In this project, we will predict Airbnb optimal listing price for the city of New York. We will take into considerations informations like property type, room type, location, ratings and seasonality to predict the price. 
### 

### Machine Learning Model Mockup
Since price is a continuous variable, we will use linear regression for our machine learning model. We will use Scikit-learn library, a python machine learning library.The target variable is Price, meaning that the goal of the linear regression model is to predict a price based on some of available features.
